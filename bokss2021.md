# 1st International Workshop on Body of Knowledge for Software Sustainability (BoKSS'21) 

- Co-located with [ICSE 2021](https://2021.icse-conferences.org) 
- in Madird, Spain 
- MM DD, 2021

## Theme & Goals

With the pervasive role of software and digitalization in all aspects of contemporary society, the topic of sustainability is becoming increasingly important and increasingly urgent for software engineers and software engineering education. But we have a scant foundation of practices, examples, tools, datasets, guidelines \etc upon which to make principled engineering decisions and upon which to build a curriculum. In spite of the active international research community in the field, we lack a strong foundation of significant and reusable {\em results} upon which to build tangible progress that helps contribute to the target sustainability goals.

The goal of BoKSS 2021 is to create such a knowledge base. We seek to create a knowledge base of actionable results that will transform sustainable software engineering practices from a novel research area into a robust, repeatable, teachable practice area within software engineering.

In addition to the knowledge base mentioned above, the envisaged workshop outcomes include forming a concrete work-force that will create (i) an online platform to share the knowledge base, and (ii) a scientific report targeting journal publication which will present the Body of Knowledge for Sustainability in Software Engineering (BoKSS) as a unified theory. Depending on the number of participants and their contributions, we can imagine more than one report resulting from this workshop.

## Topics of Interest

BoKSS 2021 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to sustainable software and software for sustainability:
- Practices for software sustainability
- Metrics and measures for software sustainability
- Applied, or experimented with, software engineering methodologies at all levels (from requirements elicitation to architecture design, coding, testing)
- Patterns and anti-patterns
- Architectural tactics, architectural styles and design patterns

## Submission Guidelines 

Prospective participants are invited to submit
- research papers presenting novel contributions on advancing software engineering in robotics (max. 8 pages);
- challenge showcase papers describing robotics challenges considered insufficiently addressed from an industry perspective (max. 6 pages);
- lessons learned papers describing lessons learned in the collaboration between the two communities of software engineering and robotics (max. 6 pages);
- vision papers on the future of software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages);
- tool and project papers on software engineering in robotics (max. 4 pages).

Workshop papers must follow the [ICSE 2019 Format and Submission Guideline](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Technical-Papers#Call-for-Papers), but will use a *single blind* submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rose2019). Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.

## Important Dates
